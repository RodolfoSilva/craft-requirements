Craft Requirements Checker
==================

Requirements checker script for Craft CMS.

Upload the entire requirements folder to your server and navigate to it with your web browser. 

The script checks your web server against Craft's minimum server requirements. It does not connect to a database so cannot check the MySQL version or that the InnoDB storage engine is installed and enabled, but this should be relatively easy to find out.
